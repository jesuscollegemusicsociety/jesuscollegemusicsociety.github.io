# About Us

As one of the most active and respected music societies across the university, Jesus College Music Society exists to
promote music-making of all kinds in the College. Alongside its orchestra, the Society runs a successful weekly
recital series in the beautiful setting of our College Chapel as well as supporting a Saxophone Ensemble and chamber
ensembles throughout the College. We host several gigs in the College bar each term.  We are also behind the well-loved
Chapel Sessions’ events -  “Blues and Chill” and “The Snowman”.

JCMS promotes a high standard of music-making from the many talented Jesuans across the College but also aims to provide
opportunities for students to partake in fun, group activities to take a break from their studies. With an orchestra, chorus,
big band and excellent practice facilities, there’s something for everyone with JCMS as students can play, sing and conduct
during their time at the College.
