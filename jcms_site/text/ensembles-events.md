# Ensembles and Events

## Orchestra

JCMS Orchestra welcomes musicians of all abilities in college to perform exciting orchestral music together. We hold
rehearsals once a week, working towards termly concerts in our beautiful chapel. Led by enthusiastic student conductors,
our repertoire features both classical favourites and lesser-known works. The annual David Crighton Concert, in Lent,
showcases a Jesuan soloist in a concerto of their choice, whilst our Easter term concert features hits from films and
musicals. Just turn up for one of our regular rehearsals on a Monday evening, 8-10pm in the chapel! Email our [Orchestral
Manager](mailto:jcms-orch-manager@jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk) with any questions.

## Recitals

JCMS holds a varied and popular recital series, with a range of performances coming from both Jesuans and further afield.
These recitals take place in our chapel weekly on Saturday at 8pm during Michaelmas and Lent term, and we hold a week-long
lunchtime recital series during May Week. If you are interested in performing, please contact our [Recitals Manager](
mailto:jcms-recitals@jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk).

## Gigs

JCMS hosts gigs several times a term, showcasing student bands and performers from across Cambridge. These take place in
the Brewery Room throughout the year. If you are interested in performing, or using the sound system in the Brewery Room,
please contact our [Gigs Managers](mailto:jcms-gigs@jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk), or check out our [Gigin
page](https://www.giginmusic.com/venues/068c9e3d-0ff5-4409-9a91-0b7ca0fb3c82).

## Chapel Sessions

The Jesus Chapel Sessions Series are a relaxed space for Jesuans to perform alternative musical genres. The popular
termly ‘Blues and Chill’ sessions feature some of our most talented acoustic and jazz musicians, and late in Michaelmas
term the annual performance of the Snowman is popular with students and staff alike. Please do not hesitate to get in
touch with our [Chapel Sessions manager](mailto:jcms-chapel-sessions@jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk) if you'd like to perform at
one of our chapel sessions.

## Jesus Jazz

A new initiative this year, Jesus Jazz will be a jazz ensemble which meets regularly for relaxed jam sessions. As the
year progresses and depending on numbers, there may be a re-launch of Jesus Big Band which will meet for regular rehearsals.
If you're interested in joining, contact our [Jazz Managers](mailto:jcms-jazz@jscsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk).

## Jesus Saxophone Ensemble

After a successful launch last year, the Jesus Saxophone Ensemble will continue to meet regularly for rehearsals and
perform termly under the direction of Adrian Ifrim.

## Jesus Guitar Ensemble

Guitar ensemble is a friendly classical guitar group open to anyone at the university. We rehearse once or twice a fortnight,
and perform once a term in JCMS recitals. We usually play pieces around a Grade 3/4 difficulty, but have options for a range
of experience levels. Please get in contact with [Sofia Monarchi](mailto:sm2796@cam.ac.uk) if you have any questions or are
interested in joining.
